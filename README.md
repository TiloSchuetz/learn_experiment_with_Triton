# learn_experiment_with_Triton

Summary of things that I want to do on this journey:

- [ ] Get GPU setup running (probably BWCluster with jupyter notebook instance)
- [ ] Summarize in my own words how parallelization on a NVIDIA GPU
- [ ] Go through Triton Tutorial to get an understanding of the Syntax
- [ ] Rewrite B-cos layer in Triton and compare performance to PyTorch implementation
- [ ] Rewrite one Normalization Layer of B-cos and compare performance to PyTorch implementation

My desired outcomes:
1. Most importantly learn something new and get a better understanding of how deep learning algorithms are parallelized
2. If performance gains can be accomplished, publish code and give it to B-cos authors
